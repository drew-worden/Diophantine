# Diophantine

A programming language for machine learning. Built for speed, efficiency, and optimization of low level constructs.

## Overview

Diophantine is a self-hosted programming language specifically designed for machine learning applications. While currently implemented in C, the language aims to provide optimal performance and fine-grained control over low-level constructs essential for machine learning operations.

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- GCC compiler
- Make build system
- clang-format (optional, for code formatting)

### Build Commands

The project uses Make for building and development tasks. The following commands are available:

- `make build` - Compiles the Diophantine compiler
- `make run` - Runs the compiled compiler
- `make all` - Builds and runs the compiler in sequence
- `make format` - Formats the source code using clang-format
- `make clean` - Removes all build artifacts
- `make help` - Displays available make commands and their descriptions
